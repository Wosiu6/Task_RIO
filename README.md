# Task_RIO
## Description
This is a task created as a part of test for a graduate position.
## Commands
Available commands and extensions:

-add (-title x/ -date x)
-showAll
-showCurrent (after tasks are filtered)
-filter (-date x/ -time x)
-sort (-d/-t > to sort by date or title)
-save (to save to file)
-load (not implemented but could be used to load from the file)
-complete (-title x/ -date x) can be used with both subcommands or just either of them

## Disclaimer
Dealing with the commands is done using an open source library found on https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3111/C-NET-Command-Line-Arguments-Parser

The application could be engineered much better than this, using command pattern for example. It was pointed out not to spend too much time on the solution, however.
