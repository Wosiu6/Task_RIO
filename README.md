Available commands and extensions:

## Disclaimer
Dealing with the commands is done using an open source library found on https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3111/C-NET-Command-Line-Arguments-Parser

The application could be engineered much better than this, using command pattern for example. It was pointed out not to spend too much time on the solution, however.
